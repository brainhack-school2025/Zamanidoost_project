I'm Yadollah (Amir) Zamanidoost, a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal. My research focuses on early-stage lung cancer detection using deep learning techniques on CT scan images. I’m passionate about applying AI in healthcare and excited to expand my skills in neural data science. I joined Brainhack School to learn new tools, collaborate with others, and explore how open science practices can support impactful research.
