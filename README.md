summary: "
This project presents a deep learning-based pipeline for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans using a customized Faster R-CNN architecture. The detection system includes a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for generating candidate tumor regions, followed by a False Positive Reduction (FPR) module based on a convolutional neural network to refine the predictions. The model is trained and evaluated on annotated MRI data and achieves improved precision and sensitivity across various IoU thresholds. The final results are visualized with bounding boxes and evaluated using metrics such as F1-score and FROC curves."

I'm Yadollah (Amir) Zamanidoost, a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal. My research focuses on early-stage lung cancer detection using deep learning techniques on CT scan images. I’m passionate about applying AI in healthcare and excited to expand my skills in neural data science. I joined Brainhack School to learn new tools, collaborate with others, and explore how open science practices can support impactful research.
